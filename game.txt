`At last, I understood.@ The feeling of deja vu and familiarity that I couldn't wipe away, which had been plaguing me ever since I first met the dandelion girl Julie Danvers.@
br
`That night, the evening before we were married, I fell asleep with a slightly puzzled feeling, like something still wasn't quite right.@
br
`Decades later, I finally understood.\

`I walked to the bus stop, where I knew it would drop Anne off after her bingo game.@
br
`I waited.@ Not for just a single hour, or even two or three.@ I sat on that bench, underneath the feeble-looking bus shelter, and waited for a long time, until Anne came to return from her Bingo game.\

`Eventually, that bus rolled up and several people got off.@ After a little shuffling, Anne stepped out too, and I gave her a start.@
br
`Unsure of what I was doing here, she just... stared...@
br
`She looked into my eyes, and after seeing some understanding at last, she looked weak in the knees.\

`"........."@
br
`"You were scared.@ So many years have passed since I met you at my practice, and we've grown old.@ I fell in love with you this year, and you returned to the past.@ Then I fell in love with you again."\

`She ran.@ Anne ran and hugged me, and buried her face in my chest.@ And she cried, and cried, and I felt yet another sting of deja vu.@ Months ago, Julie Danvers had done this too.\

`It was a warm, reassuring deja vu.@

`I had never lost Julie Danvers.@ At the same time, I had never stopped loving my wife or fallen for someone else.@

`That ended the chapter in my life about Julie Danvers.@ Or, in a way maybe it had it just begun.@
br
`Whatever the case may be, Anne and I walked hand in hand in the rain, clinging to one another.@ Anne joked that I might have caught a cold.@
br
`But she said that would be okay, since she could nurse me back to health.@ And I knew she would.\



`After a while the rain finally stopped, and we looked up at the sky.@
br
`The bright, beautiful sky began to peek through the clouds, and I thought it looked like the sky I'd seen when I first met the dandelion girl.........\
