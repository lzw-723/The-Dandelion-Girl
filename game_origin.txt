`In the middle of the golden-colored field was a beautiful girl in a white dress, dancing in circles.@

`The flowers danced around her in the breeze, and the straw hat covering her head fell off.\


`Her hair was fair, a shade or two darker than the dandelions around her.@ She let it fall over her shoulders and brush against the middle of her back, and sucked in a deep breath of the sweet Summer air.@ Then she picked up her hat, and held it.@
br
`She didn't put it back on her head right away. Instead the dandelion girl grinned and held her hand over her eyes, looking at the bright blue sky overhead, and simply took it all in.\


`It was something poetic.@ The kind of thing you'd expect someone to describe in a sonnet.@
br
`Or maybe it was something you'd expect to find in a leisurely oil painting, something warm and comfortable to hang on your wall and gaze at when the temperature gets too cold outdoors.@
br
`Mark watched the girl and felt a strange and somewhat painful deja vu, as though it was a scene he'd witnessed a dozen times before.\


`Of course, that was absurd. It was their first meeting, and never before in his life had he met such a beautiful girl.@

br
`I waited.@ Not for just a single hour, or even two or three.@ I sat on that bench, underneath the feeble-looking bus shelter, and waited for a long time, until Anne came to return from her Bingo game.\

`Eventually, that bus rolled up and several people got off.@ After a little shuffling, Anne stepped out too, and I gave her a start.@

`Unsure of what I was doing here, she just... stared...@
